    <h1>Hello World!</h1>
    <p>My name is Ankur Mittal</p>
    <p>I am a full stack Web developer. </p>
    <p>I’m a third-year B.Tech Engineering student with a passion for turning ideas into real, working solutions.
        From writing my first “Hello World” in Java to exploring full-stack web development, I’ve been on a journey of
        learning, building, and constantly improving.

        I enjoy solving problems — whether it’s debugging code at 2 AM, optimizing logic for better performance, or
        crafting user-friendly web experiences.
        My focus is on creating projects that are practical, impactful, and well-crafted.</p>
